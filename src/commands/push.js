A shortcut for \`zapier build && zapier upload\` - this is our recommended way to push an app. This is a common workflow:

1. Make changes in \`index.js\` or other files.
2. Run \`zapier test\`.
3. Run \`zapier push\`.
4. QA/experiment in the Zapier.com Zap editor.
5. Go to 1 and repeat.

> Note: this is always a safe operation as live/production apps are protected from pushes. You must use \`zapier promote\` or \`zapier migrate\` to impact live users.

If you have not yet registered your app, this command will prompt you for your app title and register the app.
