Promotes an app version into production (non-private) rotation, which means new users can use this app version.

* This **does** mark the version as the official global version - all other versions & users are grandfathered.
* This **does not** build/upload or deploy a version to Zapier - you should \`zapier push\` first.
* This **does not** move old users over to this version - \`zapier migrate 1.0.0 1.0.1\` does that.
* This **does not** recommend old users stop using this version - \`zapier deprecate 1.0.0 2017-01-01\` does that.

Promotes are an inherently safe operation for all existing users of your app.

> If this is your first time promoting - this will start the platform quality assurance process by alerting the Zapier platform team of your intent to go global. We'll respond within a few business days.

**Arguments**
