# Zapier Platform CLI

> Warning - this is currently beta software! Join our beta Slack channel https://zapier-platform-slack.herokuapp.com.

Zapier is a platform for creating integrations and workflows. This CLI is your gateway to creating custom applications on the Zapier platform.

[These docs are available here](http://zapier.github.io/zapier-platform-cli/) and the [CLI docs are available here](http://zapier.github.io/zapier-platform-cli/cli.html).

## Requirements

The Zapier CLI and Platform require Node.js `v4.3.2`. We recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to manage your Node.js installation.

On Mac (via [homebrew](http://brew.sh/)):

```bash
brew install nvm
nvm install v4.3.2
nvm use v4.3.2
```


## Tutorial

Welcome to the Zapier Platform! In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the process of building, testing, and pushing an examples app that talks to a fake/mock API to Zapier. We'll start with a minimal template with just the basics.


### Installing the CLI

To get started, first make sure that your dev environment meets the [requirements](#requirements) for running the the platform. Once you have the proper version of Node.js, install the Zapier CLI tool.

```bash
# install the CLI globally
npm install -g zapier-platform-cli
```

The CLI is the primary tool for managing your apps. With it, you can validate and test apps locally, push apps so they are available on Zapier, and view logs for debugging. To see a list of all the available commands, try `zapier help`.

Now that your CLI is installed - you'll need to identify yourself via the CLI.

```bash
# setup auth to Zapier's platform with a deploy key
zapier login
```

Now your CLI is installed and ready to go!


### Starting an App

To begin building an app, use the `init` command to setup the needed structure.

```bash
# create a directory with the minimum required files
zapier init example-app
# move into the new directory
cd example-app
```

Inside the directory, you'll see a few files. `package.json` is a typical requirements file of any Node.js application. It's pre-populated with a few dependencies, most notably the `zapier-platform-core`, which is what makes your app work with the Zapier Platform. There is also an `index.js` file and a test directory (more on those later).

Before we go any further, we need to install the dependencies for our app:

```bash
npm install
```

### Your `index.js`

Right next to `package.json` should be `index.js`, which is the entry point to your app. This is where the Platform will look for your app definition. Open it up in your editor of choice and let's take a look!

You'll see a few things in `index.js`:

 * we export a single `App` definition which will be interpreted by Zapier
 * in `App` definition, `beforeRequest` & `afterResponse` are hooks into the HTTP client
 * in `App` definition, `triggers` will describe ways to trigger off of data in your app
 * in `App` definition, `searches` will describe ways to find data in your app
 * in `App` definition, `creates` will describe ways to create data in your app
 * in `App` definition, `resources` are purely optional but convenient ways to describe CRUD-like objects in your app

### Adding a Trigger

Let's start by adding a **trigger.** We will configure it to read data from a mocked API (in the future - your real app will use a real API, of course :-):

```bash
mkdir triggers
touch triggers/recipe.js
```

> Note: The `triggers` folder is simply a convention - we recommend it as our tools support it. Also, `recipe.js` is just an example name of a model - maybe you'll eventually make a `contact.js`, `lead.js` or `order.js`.

Open `triggers/recipe.js` and **replace** it with:

```javascript
const listRecipes = (z, bundle) => {
  z.console.log('hello from a console log!');
  const promise = z.request('http://57b20fb546b57d1100a3c405.mockapi.io/api/recipes');
  return promise.then((response) => response.json);
};

module.exports = {
  key: 'recipe',
  noun: 'Recipe',
  display: {
    label: 'New Recipe',
    description: 'Trigger when a new recipe is added.'
  },
  operation: {
    perform: listRecipes
  }
};
```

Let's break down what is happening in this snippet!

First, look first at the function definition for `listRecipes`. You see that it handles the API work, making the HTTP request and returning a promise that will eventually yield a result.

It receives two arguments, a `z` object and a `bundle` object.

* The [Z Object](#z-object) is a collection of utilities needed when working with APIs. In our snippet, we use `z.request` to make the HTTP call and `z.JSON` to parse the response.
* The [Bundle Object](#bundle-object) contains any data needed to make API calls, like authentication credentials or data for a POST body. In our snippet the Bundle is not used, since we don't require any of those to make our simple GET request.

> Note about Z Object: While it is possible to accomplish the same tasks using alternate Node.js libraries, it's preferable to use the `z` object as there are features built into these utilities that augment the Zapier experience. For example, logging of HTTP calls and better handling of JSON parsing failures. [Read the docs](#z-object) for more info.

Second, look at the second part of our snippet; the export. Essentially, we export some metadata plus our `listRecipes` function. We'll explain later how Zapier uses this metadata. For now, know that it satisfies the minimum info required to define a trigger.

With our trigger defined, we need to incorporate it into our app.

In `index.js`, **edit** the file to include:

```javascript
// Place this at the top of index.js
const recipe = require('./triggers/recipe');
```

With the trigger imported, we need to register it on our app by editing the existing `triggers` property.

In `index.js`, **edit** the `App`'s `triggers` section to include:

```javascript
// Edit the App definition to register our trigger
const App = {
  // ...
  triggers: {
    [recipe.key]: recipe // new line of code
  },
  // ...
};
```

Now, let's add a test to make sure our code is working properly.

In `test/index.js`, **replace** the file with:

```javascript
const should = require('should');

const zapier = require('zapier-platform-core');

const appTester = zapier.createAppTester(require('../index'));

describe('My App', () => {

  it('should load recipes', (done) => {
    const triggerPointer = 'triggers.recipe';
    const bundle = {};

    appTester(triggerPointer, bundle)
      .then(results => {
        should(results.length).above(1);

        const firstResult = results[0];
        console.log('test result: ', firstResult)
        should(firstResult.name).eql('name 1');
        should(firstResult.directions).eql('directions 1');

        done();
      })
      .catch(done);
  });

});
```

You should be able to run the test with `zapier test` and see it pass:

```bash
zapier test
#
#   triggers
# 200 GET http://57b20fb546b57d1100a3c405.mockapi.io/api/recipes
#     ✓ should load recipes (312ms)
#
#   1 passing (312ms)
#
```

### Modifying a Trigger

Let's say we want to let our users tweak the cuisine style of recipes they are triggering on. A classic way to do that with Zapier is to provide an input field a user can fill out.

In `triggers/recipe.js`, **replace** the file with:

```javascript
const listRecipes = (z, bundle) => {
  z.console.log('hello from a console log!');
  const promise = z.request('http://57b20fb546b57d1100a3c405.mockapi.io/api/recipes', {
    // NEW CODE
    params: {
      style: bundle.inputData.style
    }
  });
  return promise.then((response) => JSON.parse(response.content));
};

module.exports = {
  key: 'recipe',
  noun: 'Recipe',
  display: {
    label: 'New Recipe',
    description: 'Trigger when a new recipe is added.'
  },
  operation: {
    // NEW CODE
    inputFields: [
      {key: 'style', type: 'string', required: false}
    ],
    perform: listRecipes
  }
};
```

Notice that we now include and use an input field keyed `"style"`. We have to add it in two places:

* In the `inputFields` on `operation` - this defines the field as exposed in the Zapier UI.
* In the `listRecipes` function - we use the provided style via the bundle `bundle.inputData.style`. Since the field is not required - it could be null!

Since we are developing locally, let's tweak the test to verify everything still works.

In `test/index.js`, **replace** the file with:

```javascript

const should = require('should');

const zapier = require('zapier-platform-core');

const appTester = zapier.createAppTester(require('../index'));

describe('My App', () => {

  it('should load recipes', (done) => {
    const triggerPointer = 'triggers.recipe';
    const bundle = {
      // NEW CODE
      inputData: {
        style: 'mediterranean'
      }
    };

    appTester(triggerPointer, bundle)
      .then(results => {
        should(results.length).above(1);

        const firstResult = results[0];
        console.log('test result: ', firstResult)
        should(firstResult.name).eql('name 1');
        should(firstResult.directions).eql('directions 1');

        done();
      })
      .catch(done);
  });

});
```

You can run your test again and make sure everything still works:

```bash
zapier test
#
#   triggers
# 200 GET http://57b20fb546b57d1100a3c405.mockapi.io/api/recipes
#     ✓ should load recipes (312ms)
#
#   1 passing (312ms)
#
```

Looking good locally! Let's move on.

### Deploying an App

So far, everything we have done has been local, on your machine. It's been fun, but we want our app on Zapier.com so we can use it with the thousands of other integrations! To do so, we need to take our working local app and push it to Zapier.

Let's push a version of your app! You can can have many versions of an app, which simplifies making breaking changes and testing in the future. For now, we just need a single version pushed.

> If this is your first time pushing your app version - we will ask you to provide a name so we can register your app - this is a one time thing!

```bash
zapier push
# Preparing to build and upload your app.
#
#   Copying project to temp directory - done!
#   Installing project dependencies - done!
#   Applying entry point file - done!
#   Validating project - done!
#   Building app definition.json - done!
#   Zipping project and dependencies - done!
#   Cleaning up temp directory - done!
#   Uploading version 1.0.0 - done!
#
# Build and upload complete! You should see it in your Zapier editor at https://testing.zapier.com/app/editor now!
```

Now that your app version is properly pushed, log in and visit [https://testing.zapier.com/app/editor](https://testing.zapier.com/app/editor) to create a Zap and check our progress.

You'll see the app listed as an available option for the first step. Selecting it, you'll see the "New Recipe" trigger. At this point, we've come full circle on the trigger definition from earlier. Remember that, as part of the metadata, we defined a `display` property with a label and help text. Those properties control the info you see inside the Zapier UI.

As you click through, you'll see our input field "style" appear, which you can fill out. Once you finish setting up the step and test it, Zapier will run the `listReceipes` function associated with the trigger, which will make the API request and return the result to Zapier. If you are curious to see what HTTP requests Zapier makes at any point, you can use the `zapier logs` command to find out.

```bash
zapier logs --type=http

# The logs of your app "Example App" listed below.
#
# ┌────────┬────────┬────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┬───────────────┬─────────┬──────────────────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────┐

# ├────────┼────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┼───────────────┼─────────┼──────────────────────────────────────┼───────────────────────────┤

#   Most recent logs near the bottom.
```

Good work, we've built a trigger locally and pushed it to Zapier.

### Adding Authentication

Up to this point we've ignored something that is usually crucial to APIs: authentication. Zapier supports a number of different [authentication schemes](#authentication). For our app, we are going to set it up to include an API Key in a header.

The first thing we need to do is define the `authentication` section on the app.

In `index.js`, **edit** `App` to include:

```javascript
const App = {
  // ...
  authentication: {
    type: 'custom',
    fields: [
      {key: 'apiKey', type: 'string'}
    ],
    test: (z, bundle) => {
      const promise = z.request('http://57b20fb546b57d1100a3c405.mockapi.io/api/me');
      return promise.then((response) => {
        if (response.status !== 200) {
          throw new Error('Invalid API Key');
        }
      });
    }
  },
  // ...
};
```

In the above snippet, we define the two required properties of `authentication`:

* `fields` is where we define our auth fields. This works similar to the `inputFields` of triggers. When users connect their account to Zapier, they'll be prompted to fill in this field, and the value they enter becomes available in the `bundle`.
* `test` is a function used during the account connection process to verify that the user entered valid credentials. The goal of the function is to make an authenticated API request whose response indicates if the credentials are correct. If valid, the test function can return anything. On invalid credentials, the test needs to raise an error.

With that setup, we now need to make sure that our API key is included in all the requests our app makes.

In `index.js`, **edit** the file to include:

```javascript
// Add this helper function above the App definition
const addApiKeyToHeader = (request, z, bundle) => {
  request.headers['MY-AUTH-HEADER'] = bundle.authData.apiKey;
  return request;
};

// const App = ...
```

Above we define a helper function, `addApiKeyToHeader`, that puts the user-provided API key in a request header called `MY-AUTH-HEADER`. The name chosen is illustrative, it can be whatever the API you are integrating with requires. Alternatively, you could put it in a query parameter instead of a header, and/or encoded it first.

To make our helper function take effect, we need to register it on our app.

In `index.js`, **edit** `App` to include:

```javascript
const App = {
  // ...
  beforeRequest: [
    addApiKeyToHeader // new line of code
  ],
  // ...
};
```

`beforeRequest` is a list of functions that are called before every HTTP request, letting you add headers, query params, etc. to all outbound requests. In our case, every HTTP request will now have the API key added in a header.

To check our progress, we need to re-push our app.

```bash
zapier push
```

Go back to your Zap at `https://testing.zapier.com`. You'll see a new 'Connect Account' item in your 'New Recipe' trigger. Add an account for our app (enter any value you like for the API key, the mock API does not care).

As soon as you add the account, Zapier will run our app's `authentication.test` function to confirm the credentials are valid.

We can verify the header is present in the request by looking at the logs again.

```bash
zapier logs --type=http --detailed --limit=1

```

You can see from the detailed log that the request included our auth header. The value appears as `:censored:6:b1af149262:`, which is intentional. Zapier does not log authentication credentials in plain text.

With that, we've successfully added authentication to our app!

### Tutorial Next Steps

Congrats, you've completed the tutorial! At this point we recommend reading up on the [Z Object](#z-object) and [Bundle Object](#bundle-object) to get a better idea of what is possible within the `perform` functions. You can also check out the other [example apps](#example-apps) to see how to incorporate different authentication schemes into your app and how to implement things like searches and creates.


## Quickstart

> Be sure to check the [Requirements](#requirements) before you start! Also, we recommend the [Tutorial](#tutorial) for a more thorough introduction.

First up is installing the CLI and setting up your auth to create a working "Zapier Example" application. It will be private to you and visible in your live [Zap editor](https://testing.zapier.com/app/editor).

```bash
# install the CLI globally
npm install -g zapier-platform-cli

# setup auth to Zapier's platform with a deploy key
zapier login
```

Your Zapier CLI should be installed and ready to go at this point. Next up, we'll create our first app!

```bash
# create a directory with the minimum required files
zapier init example-app

# move into the new directory
cd example-app

# install all the libraries needed for your app
npm install
```

> Note: there are plenty of templates & example apps to choose from! [View all Example Apps here.](#example-apps)

You should now have a working local app. You can run several local commands to try it out.

```bash
# run the local tests
# the same as npm test
zapier test
```

Next, you'll probably want to upload app to Zapier itself so you can start testing live.

```bash
# push your app to Zapier
zapier push
```

> Go check out our [full CLI reference documentation](docs/cli.md) to see all the other commands!


## Creating a Local App

> Tip: check the [Quickstart](#quickstart) if this is your first time using the platform!

Creating an App can be done entirely locally and they are fairly simple Node.js apps using the standard Node environment and should be completely testable. However, a local app stays local until you `zapier register`.

```bash
# make your folder
mkdir zapier-example
cd zapier-example

# create the needed files from a template
zapier init . --template=trigger

# install all the libraries needed for your app
npm install
```

If you'd like to manage your **local App**, use these commands:

* `zapier init . --template=resource` - initialize/start a local app project
* `zapier convert 1234 .` - initialize/start from an existing app (alpha)
* `zapier scaffold resource Contact` - auto-injects a new resource, trigger, etc.
* `zapier test` - run the same tests as `npm test`
* `zapier validate` - ensure your app is valid
* `zapier describe` - print some helpful information about your app

### Local Project Structure

In your app's folder, you should see this general recommended structure. The `index.js` is Zapier's entry point to your app. Zapier expects you to export an `App` definition there.

```plain
$ tree .
.
├── README.md
├── index.js
├── package.json
├── triggers

### Local App Definition

The core definition of your `App` will look something like this, and is what your `index.js` should provide as the _only_ export:

```javascript
[insert-file:./snippets/app-def.js]
```

> Tip: you can use higher order functions to create any part of your App definition!


## Registering an App

Registering your App with Zapier is a necessary first step which only enables basic administrative functions. It should happen before `zapier push` which is to used to actually expose an App Version in the Zapier interface and editor.

```bash
# register your app
zapier register "Zapier Example"

# list your apps
zapier apps
```

> Note: this doesn't put your app in the editor - see the docs on pushing an App Version to do that!

If you'd like to manage your **App**, use these commands:

* `zapier apps` - list the apps in Zapier you can administer
* `zapier register "Name"` - creates a new app in Zapier
* `zapier link` - lists and links a selected app in Zapier to your current folder
* `zapier history` - print the history of your app
* `zapier collaborate [user@example.com]` - add admins to your app who can push
* `zapier invite [user@example.com]` - add users to try your app before promotion


## Deploying an App Version

An App Version is related to a specific App but is an "immutable" implementation of your app. This makes it easy to run multiple versions for multiple users concurrently. By default, **every App Version is private** but you can `zapier promote` it to production for use by over 1 million Zapier users.

```bash
# push your app version to Zapier
zapier push

# list your versions
zapier versions
```

If you'd like to manage your **Version**, use these commands:

* `zapier versions` - list the versions for the current directory's app
* `zapier push` - push the current version the of current directory's app & version (read from `package.json`)
* `zapier promote [1.0.0]` - mark a version as the "production" version
* `zapier migrate [1.0.0] [1.0.1] [100%]` - move users between versions, regardless of deployment status
* `zapier deprecate [1.0.0] [YYYY-MM-DD]` - mark a version as deprecated, but let users continue to use it (we'll email them)
* `zapier env 1.0.0 [KEY] [value]` - set an environment variable to some value


### Private App Version (default)

A simple `zapier push` will only create the App Version in your editor. No one else using Zapier can see it or use it.


### Sharing an App Version

This is how you would share your app with friends, co-workers or clients. This is perfect for quality assurance, testing with active users or just sharing any app you like.

```bash
# sends an email this user to let them view the app in the UI privately
zapier invite user@example.com

# sends an email this user to let them admin the app (make changes just like you)
zapier collaborate user@example.com
```

You can also invite anyone on the internet to your app by observing the URL at the bottom of `zapier invite`, it should look something like `https://zapier.com/platform/public-invite/1/222dcd03aed943a8676dc80e2427a40d/`. You can put this in your help docs, post it to Twitter, add it to your email campaign, etc.


### Promoting an App Version

Promotion is how you would share your app with every one of the 1 million+ Zapier users. If this is your first time promoting - you may have to wait for the Zapier team to review and approve your app.

If this isn't the first time you've promoted your app - you might have users on older versions. You can `zapier migrate` to either move users over (which can be dangerous if you have breaking changes). Or, you can `zapier deprecate` to give users some time to move over themselves.

```bash
# promote your app version to all Zapier users
zapier promote 1.0.1

# OPTIONAL - migrate your users between one app version to another
zapier migrate 1.0.0 1.0.1

# OR - mark the old version as deprecated
zapier deprecate 1.0.0 2017-01-01
```

## Converting an Existing App

> Warning! This is in a **very** alpha state - the immediate goal is to provide some basic structure to match an existing application. It will not even get close to a working copy of your existing app (yet).

If you have an existing application (nominally named "V2") on https://zapier.com/developer/builder/ you can use it as a template to kickstart your local application.

```bash
# the 1234 is from the URL in https://zapier.com/developer/builder/
zapier convert 1234 .
```

You app will be created and you can continue working on it.

> Note - there is no way to convert a CLI app to a V2 app and we do not plan on implementing this.

## Authentication

Most applications require some sort of authentication - and Zapier provides a handful of methods for helping your users authenticate with your application. Zapier will provide some of the core behaviors, but you'll likely need to handle the rest.

> Hint: You can access the data tied to your authentication via the `bundle.authData` property in any method called in your app.

### Basic

Useful if your app requires two pieces of information to authentication: `username` and `password` which only the end user can provide. By default, Zapier will do the standard Basic authentication base64 header encoding for you (via an automatically registered middleware).

> Note: if you do the common API Key pattern like `Authorization: Basic APIKEYHERE:x` you should look at the "Custom" authentication method instead.

```javascript
[insert-file:./snippets/basic-auth.js]
```

### Custom

This is what most "API Key" driven apps should default to using. You'll likely provide some some custom `beforeRequest` middleware or a `requestTemplate` to complete the authentication by adding/computing needed headers.

```javascript
[insert-file:./snippets/custom-auth.js]
```

### Digest

Very similar to the "Basic" authentication method above, but uses digest authentication instead of Basic authentication.

```javascript
[insert-file:./snippets/digest-auth.js]
```

### Session

Probably the most "powerful" mechanism for authentication - it gives you the ability to exchange some user provided data for some authentication data (IE: username & password for a session key).

```javascript
[insert-file:./snippets/session-auth.js]
```

### OAuth2

Zapier will handle most of the logic around the 3 step OAuth flow, but you'll be required to define how the steps work on your own. You'll also likely want to set your `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` as environment variables:

```bash
# setting the environment variables on Zapier.com
$ zapier env 1.0.0 CLIENT_ID 1234
$ zapier env 1.0.0 CLIENT_SECRET abcd

# and when running tests locally, don't forget to define them!
$ CLIENT_ID=1234 CLIENT_SECRET=abcd zapier test
```

Your auth definition would look something like this:

```javascript
[insert-file:./snippets/oauth2.js]
```

## Resources

A `resource` is a representation (as a JavaScript object) of one of the REST resources of your API. Say you have a `/recipes`
endpoint for working with recipes; you can define a recipe resource in your app that will tell Zapier how to do create,
read, and search operations on that resource.

```javascript
[insert-file:./snippets/resources.js]
```

The quickest way to create a resource is with the `zapier scaffold` command:

```bash
zapier scaffold resource "Recipe"
```

This will generate the resource file and add the necessary statements to the `index.js` file to import it.


### Resource Definition

A resource has a few basic properties. The first is the `key`, which allows Zapier to identify the resource on our backend.
The second is the `noun`, the user-friendly name of the resource that is presented to users throughout the Zapier UI.

After those, there is a set of optional properties that tell Zapier what methods can be performed on the resource.
The complete list of available methods can be found in the [Resource Schema Docs](https://github.com/zapier/zapier-platform-schema/blob/master/docs/build/schema.md#resourceschema).
For now, let's focus on two:

 * `list` - Tells Zapier how to fetch a set of this resource. This becomes a Trigger in the Zapier Editor.
 * `create` - Tells Zapier how to create a new instance of the resource. This becomes an Action in the Zapier Editor.

Here is a complete example of what the list method might look like

```javascript
[insert-file:./snippets/recipe-list.js]
```

The method is made up of two properties, a `display` and an `operation`. The `display` property ([schema](https://github.com/zapier/zapier-platform-schema/blob/master/docs/build/schema.md#basicdisplayschema)) holds the info needed to present the method as an available Trigger in the Zapier Editor. The `operation` ([schema](https://github.com/zapier/zapier-platform-schema/blob/master/docs/build/schema.md#resourceschema)) provides the implementation to make the API call.

Adding a create method looks very similar.

```javascript
[insert-file:./snippets/recipe-create.js]
```

Every method you define on a `resource` Zapier converts to the appropriate Trigger, Create, or Search. Our examples
above would result in an app with a New Recipe Trigger and an Add Recipe Create.


## Triggers/Searches/Creates

Triggers, Searches, and Creates are the way an app defines what it is able to do. Triggers read
data into Zapier (i.e. watch for new recipes). Searches locate individual records (find recipe by title). Creates create
new records in your system (add a recipe to the catalog).

The definition for each of these follows the same structure. Here is an example of a trigger:

```javascript
[insert-file:./snippets/trigger.js]
```

You can find more details on the definition for each by looking at the [Trigger Schema](https://github.com/zapier/zapier-platform-schema/blob/master/docs/build/schema.md#triggerschema),
[Search Schema](https://github.com/zapier/zapier-platform-schema/blob/master/docs/build/schema.md#searchschema), and [Create Schema](https://github.com/zapier/zapier-platform-schema/blob/master/docs/build/schema.md#createschema).


## Z Object

We provide several methods off of the `z` object, which is provided as the first argument to all function calls in your app.

> The `z` object is passed into your functions as the first argument - IE: `perform: (z) => {}`.

### `z.request([url], options)`

`z.request([url], options)` is a promise based HTTP client with some Zapier-specific goodies. See [Making HTTP Requests](#making-http-requests).

### `z.console(message)`

`z.console(message)` is a logging console, similar to Node.js `console` but logs remotely, as well as to stdout in tests. See [Log Statements](#console-logging)

### `z.dehydrate(methodOrFunc, inputData)`

`z.dehydrate(methodOrFunc, inputData)` is used to lazily evaluate a function, perfect to avoid API calls during polling or for reuse. See [Dehydration](#dehydration).

### `z.stashFile(bufferStringStream, [knownLength], [filename])`

`z.stashFile(bufferStringStream, [knownLength], [filename])` is a promise based file stasher that returns a URL file pointer. See [Stashing Files](#stashing-files).

### `z.JSON`

`z.JSON` is similar to the JSON built-in like `z.JSON.parse('...')`, but catches errors and produces nicer tracebacks.

### `z.hash()`

`z.hash()` is a crypto tool for doing things like `z.hash('sha256', 'my password')`

### `z.errors`

`z.errors` is a collection error classes that you can throw in your code, like `throw new z.errors.HaltedError('...')`


## Bundle Object

This object holds the user's auth details and the data to for the API requests.

> The `bundle` object is passed into your functions as the second argument - IE: `perform: (z, bundle) => {}`.

### `bundle.authData`

`bundle.authData` is user-provided authentication data, like `api_key` or `access_token`. [Read more on authentication.](#authentication)

### `bundle.inputData` 

`bundle.inputData` is user-provided data for this particular run of the trigger/search/create, as defined by the inputFields. For example:

```javascript
{
  createdBy: 'Bobby Flay'
  style: 'mediterranean'
}
```

### `bundle.inputDataRaw`

`bundle.inputDataRaw` is kind of like `inputData`, but before rendering `{{curlies}}`:

```javascript
{
  createdBy: '{{chef_name}}'
  style: '{{style}}'
}
```

### `bundle.meta`

`bundle.meta` is extra information useful for doing advanced behaviors depending on what the user is doing. It looks something like this:

```javascript
{
  frontend: false,
  prefill: false,
  hydrate: true,
  test_poll: false,
  standard_poll: true,
  first_poll: false,
  limit: -1,
  page: 0,
}
```

For example - if you want to do pagination - you could do:

```javascript
const getList = (z, bundle) => {
  const promise = z.request({
    url: 'http://example.com/api/list.json',
    params: {
      limit: 100,
      offset: 100 * bundle.meta.page
    }
  });
  return promise.then((response) => response.json);
};
```


## Environment

Apps can define environment variables that are available when the app's code executes. They work just like environment
variables defined on the command line. They are useful when you have data like an OAuth client ID and secret that you
don't want to commit to source control. Environment variables can also be used as a quick way to toggle between a
a staging and production environment during app development.

It is important to note that **variables are defined on a per-version basis!** When you push a new version, the
existing variables from the previous version are copied, so you don't have to manually add them. However, edits
made to one version's environment will not affect the other versions.

### Defining Environment Variables

To define an environment variable, use the `env` command:

```bash
# Will set the environment variable on Zapier.com
zapier env 1.0.0 MY_SECRET_VALUE 1234
```

You will likely also want to set the value locally for testing.

```bash
export MY_SECRET_VALUE=1234
```

Alternatively, we provide some extra tooling to work with an `.environment` that looks like this:

```
MY_SECRET_VALUE=1234
```

And then in your `test/index.js` file:

```javascript
const zapier = require('zapier-platform-core');

should('some tests', () => {
  zapier.tools.env.inject();
  console.log(process.env.MY_SECRET_VALUE);
  // should print '1234'
});
```

> This is a popular way to provide `process.env.ACCESS_TOKEN || bundle.authData.access_token` for convenient testing.


### Accessing Environment Variables

To view existing environment variables, use the `env` command.

```bash
# Will print a table listing the variables for this version
zapier env 1.0.0
```

Within your app, you can access the environment via the standard `process.env` - any values set via local `export` or `zapier env` will be there.

For example, you can access the `process.env` in your perform functions:

```javascript
[insert-file:./snippets/process-env.js]
```


## Making HTTP Requests

There are two primary ways to make HTTP requests in the Zapier platform:

1. **Shorthand HTTP Requests** - these are simple object literals that make it easy to define simple requests.
1. **Manual HTTP Requests** - this is much less "magic", you use `z.request([url], options)` to make the requests and control the response.

There are also a few helper constructs you can use to reduce boilerplate:

1. `requestTemplate` which is an shorthand HTTP request that will be merged with every request.
2. `beforeRequest` middleware which is an array of functions to mutate a request before it is sent.
2. `afterResponse` middleware which is an array of functions to mutate a response before it is completed.

> Note: you can install any HTTP client you like - but this is greatly discouraged as you lose [automatic HTTP logging](#http-logging) and middleware.

### Shorthand HTTP Requests

For simple HTTP requests that do not require special pre or post processing, you can specify the HTTP options as an object literal in your app definition.

This features:

1. Lazy `{{curly}}` replacement.
2. JSON de-serialization.
3. Automatic non-2xx error raising.

```javascript
[insert-file:./snippets/shorthand-request.js]
```

In the url above, `{{bundle.authData.subdomain}}` is automatically replaced with the live value from the bundle. If the call returns a non 2xx return code, an error is automatically raised. The response body is automatically parsed as JSON and returned.

An error will be raised if the response is not valid JSON, so _do not use shorthand HTTP requests with non-JSON responses_.

### Manual HTTP Requests

When you need to do custom processing of the response, or need to process non-JSON responses, you can make manual HTTP requests. This approach does not perform any magic - no status code checking, no automatic JSON parsing. Use this method when you need more control. Manual requests do perform lazy `{{curly}}` replacement.

To make a manual HTTP request, use the `request` method of the `z` object:

```javascript
[insert-file:./snippets/manual-request.js]
```

#### POST and PUT Requests

To POST or PUT data to your API you can do this:

```javascript
[insert-file:./snippets/put.js]
```

> Note: you need to call `z.JSON.stringify()` before setting the `body`.

### Using HTTP middleware

If you need to process all HTTP requests in a certain way, you may be able to use one of utility HTTP middleware functions, by putting them in your app definition:

```javascript
[insert-file:./snippets/middleware.js]
```

A `beforeRequest` middleware function takes a request options object, and returns a (possibly mutated) request object. An `afterResponse` middleware function takes a response object, and returns a (possibly mutated) response object. Middleware functions are executed in the order specified in the app definition, and each subsequent middleware receives the request or response object returned by the previous middleware.

Middleware functions can be asynchronous - just return a promise from the middleware function.

### HTTP Request Options

Shorthand requests and manual `z.request([url], options)` calls support the following HTTP `options`:

* `url`: HTTP url, you can provide it both `z.request(url, options)` or `z.request({url: url, ...})`.
* `method`: HTTP method, default is `GET`.
* `headers`: request headers object, format `{'header-key': 'header-value'}`.
* `params`: URL query params object, format `{'query-key': 'query-value'}`.
* `body`: request body, can be a string, buffer, or readable stream. Default is `null`.
* `json`: shortcut object/array/etc. you want to JSON encode into body. Default is `null`.
* `form`: shortcut object. you want to form encode into body. Default is `null`.
* `raw`: set this to stream the response instead of consuming it immediately. Default is `false`.
* `redirect`: set to `manual` to extract redirect headers, `error` to reject redirect, default is `follow`.
* `follow`: maximum redirect count, set to `0` to not follow redirects. default is `20`.
* `compress`: support gzip/deflate content encoding. Set to `false` to disable. Default is `true`.
* `agent`: Node.js `http.Agent` instance, allows custom proxy, certificate etc. Default is `null`.
* `timeout`: request / response timeout in ms. Set to `0` to disable (OS limit still applies), timeout reset on `redirect`. Default is `0` (disabled).
* `size`: maximum response body size in bytes. Set to `0`` to disable. Default is `0` (disabled).

```javascript
z.request({
  url: 'http://example.com',
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  // only provide body, json or form...
  body: '{"hello":"world"}', // or 'hello=world'
  json: {hello: 'world'},
  form: {hello: 'world'},
  // access node-fetch style response.body
  raw: false,
  redirect: 'follow',
  follow: 20,
  compress: true,
  agent: null,
  timeout: 0,
  size: 0,
})
```

### HTTP Response Object

The response object returned by `z.request([url], options)` supports the following fields and methods:

* `status`: The response status code, i.e. `200`, `404`, etc.
* `content`: The response content as a String. For Buffer, try `options.raw = true`.
* `json`: The response content as an object (or `undefined`). If `options.raw = true` - is a promise.
* `body`: A stream available only if you provide `options.raw = true`.
* `headers`: Response headers object. The header keys are all lower case.
* `getHeader(key)`: Retrieve response header, case insensitive: `response.getHeader('My-Header')`
* `throwForStatus()`: Throw error if final `response.status > 300`. Will throw `z.error.RefreshAuthError` if 401.
* `request`: The original request options object (see above).

```javascript
z.request({
  // ..
}).then((response) => {
  response.status;
  response.headers['Content-Type'];
  response.getHeader('content-type');
  response.request; // original request options
  response.throwForStatus();
  // if options.raw === false (default)...
  JSON.parse(response.content);
  response.json;
  // if options.raw === true...
  response.buffer().then(buf => buf.toString());
  response.text().then(content => content);
  response.json().then(json => json);
  response.body.pipe(otherStream);
});
```


## Dehydration

Dehydration, and it's counterpart Hydration, is a tool that can lazily load data that might be otherwise expensive to retrieve aggressively.

* **Dehydration** - think of this as "make a pointer", you control the creation of pointers with `z.dehydrate(methodOrFunc, inputData)`
* **Hydration** - think of this as an automatic step that "consumes a pointer" and "returns some data", Zapier does this automatically behind the the scenes

> This is very common when [Stashing Files](#stashing-files) - but that isn't their only use!

The interface `z.dehydrate(methodOrFunc, inputData)` has two required arguments:

* `methodOrFunc` - this can either be a string method of something that can be found in the root `hydrators` mapping, or any raw `function` that be found _anywhere_ in your app definition
* `inputData` - this is an object that contains things like a `path` or `id` - whatever you need to load data on the other side

This example that pulls in extra data for a movie:

```javascript
[insert-file:./snippets/dehydration.js]
```

And in future steps of the Zap - if Zapier encounters a pointer as returned by `z.dehydrate(methodOrFunc, inputData)` - Zapier will tie it back to your app and pull in the data lazily.

> **Wait, but why?** Isn't it just easier to load the data immediately? In some cases it can - but imagine an API that returns 100 records when polling - doing 100x `GET /id.json` aggressive inline HTTP calls when 99% of the time Zapier doesn't _need_ the data yet is wasteful.


## Stashing Files

It can be expensive to download and stream files or they can require complex handshakes to authorize downloads - so we provide a helpful stash routine that will take any `String`, `Buffer` or `Stream` and return a URL file pointer suitable for returning from triggers, searches, creates, etc.

The interface `z.stashFile(bufferStringStream, [knownLength], [filename])` takes a single required argument - the extra two arguments will be automatically populated in most cases. For example - a full example is this:

```javascript
const content = 'Hello world!';
z.stashFile(content, content.length, 'hello.txt')
  .then(url => z.console.log(url));
// https://zapier-dev-files.s3.amazonaws.com/cli-platform/f75e2819-05e2-41d0-b70e-9f8272f9eebf
```

Most likely you'd want to stream from another URL - note the usage of `z.request({raw: true})`:

```javascript
const fileRequest = z.request({url: 'http://example.com/file.pdf', raw: true});
z.stashFile(fileRequest) // knownLength and filename will be sniffed from the request
  .then(url => z.console.log(url));
// https://zapier-dev-files.s3.amazonaws.com/cli-platform/74bc623c-d94d-4cac-81f1-f71d7d517bc7
```

> Note: you should only be using `z.stashFile()` in a hydration method - otherwise it can be very expensive to stash dozens of files in a polling call - for example! 

See a full example with dehydration/hydration wired in correctly:

```javascript
[insert-file:./snippets/stash-file.js]
```


## Logging

There are two types of logs for a Zapier app, console logs and HTTP logs. The console logs are created by your app through the use of the `z.console` method ([see below for details](#console-logging)). The HTTP logs are created automatically by Zapier whenever your app makes HTTP requests (as long as you use `z.request([url], options)` or shorthand request objects).

To view the logs for your application, use the `zapier logs` command. There are two types of logs, `http` (logged automatically by Zapier on HTTP requests) and `console` (manual logs via `z.console.log()` statements).

For advanced logging options including only displaying the logs for a certain user or app version, look at the help for the logs command:

```bash
zapier help logs
```

### Console Logging

To manually print a log statement in your code, use `z.console`:

```javascript
z.console.log('Here are the input fields', bundle.inputData);
```

The `z.console` object has all the same methods and works just like the Node.js [`Console`](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v4.x/docs/api/console.html) class - the only difference is we'll log to our distributed datastore and you can view them via `zapier logs` (more below).

### Viewing Console Logs

To see your `z.console` logs, do:

```bash
zapier logs --type=console
```

### HTTP Logging

If you are using the `z.request()` shortcut that we provide - HTTP logging is handled automatically for you. For example:

```javascript
z.request('http://57b20fb546b57d1100a3c405.mockapi.io/api/recipes')
  .then((res) => {
    // do whatever you like, this request is already getting logged! :-D
    return res;
  })
```

### Viewing HTTP Logs

To see the HTTP logs, do:

```bash
zapier logs --type=http
```
To see detailed http logs including headers, request and response bodies, etc, do:

```bash
zapier logs --type=http --detailed
```


## Testing

You can write unit tests for your Zapier app that run locally, outside of the zapier editor.
You can run these tests in a CI tool like [Travis](https://travis-ci.com/).

### Writing Unit Tests

We recommend using the [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) testing framework. After running
`zapier init` you should find an example test to start from in the `test` directory.

```javascript
[insert-file:./snippets/mocha-test.js]
```

### Running Unit Tests

To run all your tests do:

```bash
zapier test
```

> You can also go direct with `npm test` or `node_modules/mocha/bin/mocha`.

### Testing & Environment Variables

These work much like normal environment variables - for example:

```bash
CLIENT_ID=1234 CLIENT_SECRET=abcd zapier test
```

Or, `export` them explicitly and place them into the environment:

```bash
export CLIENT_ID=1234
export CLIENT_SECRET=abcd
zapier test
```


### Viewing HTTP Logs in Unit Tests


When running a unit test via `zapier test`, `z.console` statements and detailed HTTP logs print to `stdout`:

```bash
zapier test
```

Sometimes you don't want that much logging, for example in a CI test. To suppress the detailed HTTP logs do:

```bash
zapier test --quiet
```

To also suppress the HTTP summary logs do:

```bash
zapier test --very-quiet
```

### Testing in your CI (Jenkins/Travis/etc.)

Behind the scenes `zapier test` doing pretty standard `npm test` with [mocha](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mocha) as the backend.

This makes it pretty straightforward to integrate into your testing interface. If you'd like to test with [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/) for example - the `.travis.yml` would look something like this:

```yaml
language: node_js
node_js:
  - "4.3.2"
before_script: npm install -g zapier-platform-cli
script: CLIENT_ID=1234 CLIENT_SECRET=abcd zapier test
```

But you can substitute `zapier test` with `npm test`, or a direct call to `node_modules/mocha/bin/mocha`. Also, we generally recommend putting the environment variables into whatever configuration screen Jenkins or Travis provides!


## Using `npm` Modules

Use `npm` modules just like you would use them in any other node app, for example:

```bash
npm install --save jwt
```

And then `package.json` will be updated, and you can use them like anything else:

```javascript
const jwt = require('jwt');
```

During the `zapier build` or `zapier push` step - we'll copy all your code to `/tmp` folder and do a fresh re-install of modules.

> Note: If your package isn't being pushed correctly (IE: you get "Error: Cannot find module 'whatever'" in production), try adding the `--disable-dependency-detection` flag to `zapier push`.

> Warning: do not use compiled libraries unless you run your build on the AWS AMI `ami-6869aa05`.


## Using Transpilers

We do not yet support transpilers out of the box, but if you would like to use `babel` or similar, we recommend creating a custom wrapper on `zapier push` like this in your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "zapier-dev": "babel src --out-dir lib --watch",
    "zapier-push": "babel src --out-dir lib && zapier push"
  }
}
```

And then you can have your fancy ES7 code in `src/*` and a root `index.js` like this:

```javascript
module.exports = require('./lib');
```

And work with commands like this:

```bash
# watch and recompile
npm run zapier-dev

# tests should work fine
zapier test

# every build ensures a fresh build
npm run zapier-push
```
